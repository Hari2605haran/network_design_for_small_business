# Network Design for Small Business

## Overview
Welcome to the **Network Design for Small Business** project using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. This project simulates a small business network comprising four distinct departments:

- **Server Room**
- **Chairman Room**
- **IT Department**
- **Computer Department**

This document provides installation instructions, tutorials for learning **Cisco Packet Tracer**, and step-by-step guidance on configuring network devices, including end devices, switches, and routers.

## Installation Instructions
### 1. Download Cisco Packet Tracer
To begin, download **Cisco Packet Tracer** from the official **Cisco Networking Academy** website. You may need to create an account or log in to access the download link.

### 2. Install Cisco Packet Tracer
